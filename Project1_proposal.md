**The World Fair:**


Many Chicagoians know that “The World Fair” was a famous trademark in the rich history of the city. This fair took place in Chicago in 1893, and yet many do not realize how important this event was for the history, evolution, and innovation of not only the city of Chicago or the country, but for the world today. Certain inventions such as the zipper, Cracker Jacks, elevators, brownies, and more were introduced to the world for the first time at this fair. I wish to research more about what really happened at this fair in all its glory! All of the vendors shouting for business or attention, the gossip of fashion, what inventions were rejected or accepted, the conversation topics between two people from completely different backgrounds, serial killers attending the fair, and so on!  


**Prostitution:**


Prostitution is a topic surrounding much negativity or temporary pleasures in regards to the public understanding over the years. The red light district, street walking, sex work, or ladies of the night, are among the multiple terms meaning prositiution in different areas of the world, different times, different understandings of what a prostitute does and/or goes through. I wish to research more in depth of the prostitution history of Chicago. Furthermore, I wish to unveil aspects of this work to resemble feminism, and embrace of sexuality, confidence against slut shaming, women in power, etc. Chicago’s history in prostitution is fascinating and interesting. I wish to resemble its history to be far from the general image it pertains to the public (being negative), and instead I wish to indulge the positives that come out from this line of work.  


**Crime:**


A lot of crime in Chicago occurs on a continuous basis. Al Capone, along with many other infamous criminals became a large part of Chicago’s history. Certain criminals influence the city to stand in support during the criminal’s trial. Other time’s the criminal is pronounced dead before she or he must take the stand. The history of crime in Chicago is nothing short of unique. I am inspired to make an aesthetically connected zine that deals with how criminals are all unique in their own way, yet all connected to represent the word, “criminal.” Whether this is due to style, actions, the city of Chicago, etc. Criminals are becoming a trend in today’s age with the multitude of shows such as, “True Crime, Dateline, 20/20, 24 Hours, etc.” I wish to incorporate an aesthetically fascinating zine regarding the unpredictability of criminals over the years and throughout Chicago. A closer look inside a criminal’s mind.
